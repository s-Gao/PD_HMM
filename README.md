# PD_HMM

The DataPreProcess.m file in the "Preliminary Plot of Data" folder would plot tremor score and activity level with medication time and assumed sleep time with data averaged within one minute.

The visualize.m in "Baum-Welch_multi" folder would perform data preprocessing and learn the model for HMM. After that, visualize_test.m in "Baum-Welch_multi" folder would run Viterbi algorithm and do some basic interpretation of the result.
